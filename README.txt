PIC18_Based_Digital_Oscilloscope
================================

PIC18 Based Mini Digital Oscilloscope With Record Capability.

It's a small Oscilloscope Circuit with SD Card.

The PIC18 Micro Controller retrieves the signal using the Analog to digital converter,

then the signal is displayed on the Graphic LCD. 

The acquired signal is saved on the SD Card.

The code was written using MikroC for PIC of MikroElektronika.

The circuit was simulated by Proteus ISIS 8.1 SP1.

You must include the following Libraries:

 - GLCD & GLCD Fonts
 - ADC
 - MMC,MMC FAT16 & MMC FAT16 Config
 - SPI 
 - C_Math, C_String, C_Stdlib

No interruption methode was used.
